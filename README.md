# Liang's Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio on GitHub! I'm Liang, a Bay Area storyteller who found their voice through writing. Growing up, I believed I wanted to build, but soon realized my passion lay in teaching and connecting with others through words. That realization led me to technical writing, where I merge my engineering background with a teacher's mindset.

For over a decade, I've been breaking down complex problems into simple components and using words to bridge the gap between technical concepts and everyday understanding. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with renowned companies such as PayPal, Silver Peak, and F5 Networks. At these companies, I've played various roles in technical writing, leading initiatives to elevate developer documentation, ensuring comprehensive and user-friendly content for critical products, and writing technical documentation for a diverse range of products serving broad customer bases.

When I'm not immersed in the world of technical writing, you'll often find me experimenting in the kitchen (mostly Chinese cuisine), learning about video game design, delving into the history of comic books, or escaping into the realms of sci-fi and fantasy literature.

## Key Features

- **Clear Communication:** I prioritize clarity and coherence in all my documentation, ensuring that readers can easily understand and follow the information provided.
- **Technical Accuracy:** Diligently researching and verifying technical details to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **User-Centric Approach:** Understanding the needs and expectations of users to create documentation that addresses their pain points effectively.
- **Collaborative Spirit:** Thriving in collaborative environments, working closely with stakeholders to align documentation with project goals and objectives.
